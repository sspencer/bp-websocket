# WebSocket

WebSocket is a proof-of-concept BrowserPlus service that creates a persistent TCP Client 
connection within Ruby.  JavaScript in the browser registers a callback that is notified
immediately whenever the TCP Server sends data down the pipe, no polling necessary!

Install the WebSocket service locally using the BrowserPlus SDK ServiceInstaller executable.
The SDK is located here: http://browserplus.yahoo.com/developer/service/sdk/ .
Then start the sample TCP Server:

    ruby bp-websocket/src/test/chat_server.rb

This is hard coded to create the server on localhost:2626.

Assuming BrowserPlus is installed, point your browser to:

    bp-websocket/src/test/index.html

Once connected, the server sends a "ping" every 10 seconds.

If you want to see more "data", start telnet on the command line:

    $ telnet localhost 2626
    [and type some messages]
    [you will see them immediately in the browser]
